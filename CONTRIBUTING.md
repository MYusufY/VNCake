# Contributing

If you want to improve, fix, or change something about VNCake, I'm always open to PRs.  
If you want to contribute but have no idea what to contribute, you can take a look at these TODOs:

- [ ] Self-tunneling  
- [ ] Multi-OS (ISO) option  
- [ ] Improved README  
- [ ] Deployment via a package manager  

Changes that address one of these TODOs or otherwise improve the project in line with its vision are very likely to be merged!

## Pull Request Requirements

1. Ensure it really works.  
2. If changes are required, please update `README.md` accordingly.  
3. Keep the code as clean as possible.
